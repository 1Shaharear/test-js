# INCENTIVE GAMES

Hi! This is a Javascript test where you will do some functions to prove what you are made of.

Use ES6 if you are familiar with it.

## HOW TO DO IT

Simply create js file and write some code. Using console.log is fine to output the results of your code.

## EXAMPLE

```
const mySolution = () => {
  const n = 6 + 4;
  console.log(`The solution is ${n}`);
}

// Please run the file to see the results
mySolution();
```
